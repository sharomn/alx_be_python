# Define the principal amount
principal = 1000  # $1000

# Define the annual interest rate (as a decimal)
rate = 0.05  # 5%

# Define the time in years
time = 3  # 3 years

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
